Dear Reader,

however fancy might you find the information on this website, please, remain skeptical and critical. We put huge effort and passion into posting only refined high-quality content here and we sincerely believe in what we do. Yet information we deal with here is uncertain and opinion-based by its nature. Some statements are factual and so easily verifiable (or falsifiable), and we promise to do our best to put only super-verified facts. Still most of the claims are just _opinions_, interpretations, points of view. Beware of that and don't take it for granted.

We understand the responsibility of information sharing, especially in Internet era. We take it even more seriously given the audience we target here: newcomers can be particularly impressionable and delusion-prone. 

Software design remains a craft. Most of design issues still remain open. Even most respectable personalities in software engineering still are humans and make mistakes and deluge as all humans do sooner or later. Just don't trust any authorities, however credible they seem. YOU are the only responsible person for your decisions, so whoever gives you any advices or expert opinions &mdash; never apply those without careful reasoning on your own. And first of all this applies to information on this website: we can guarantee only our intent, but we cannot guarantee we are not wrong. No one can do that! The more confidence you see in someone's words, the more hesitation you should have. What we can promise is we publish only the portion of knowledge we are certain about most of all. And that we will always admit our mistakes and keep our standpoint consistent.
