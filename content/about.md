### Terminology agreement

**OOD ≈ OOAD.** To align with domain name, simplify (mental) pronunciation, and save 1 char across many acronym usages all around we imply that OOD in most cases also involves some analysis and really is OOAD. When we specifically need to mention OOA or OOAD — we say it explicitly.

**OOD == OOP.** We don't want to go sophistic: maybe in some context it matters (though we doubt), but for us on this website there is no difference whether you _design_ something or _program_. Design we discuss here means the lowest level of application and always means actual code, not just some abstract diagrams.  

**Design == Software design.** For brevity. When we want to mention any other type of design e.g. UI design — we say UI design.

**OOD != Software design.** Rather `OOD ⊂ Software design`. When we say "OOD" we want to stress on presence of object-oriented decomposition paradigm in given case. When we mention "software design" or just "design" in some claim — we mean our claim applies _not only_ to OOD. :star2: There is also [tutorial article](/tutorial/ood-defined) about this.

### What this website *is*

- Simplified presentation of OOD device to _beginner_ software developers, e.g. students with minimal to none industrial experience, but overall tech-savvy, comfortable in general programming and formal reasoning.

- Tool for building mental framework to master OOD and enable _independent_ reasoning about it 

- Summary and interpretation of blended experience of several years learning, applying, and teaching OOD

- Theoretical companion for [OOAD course at UKMA](/ukma)

Structurally content is organized into these:

- **[Glossary](/glossary)** &mdash; quick reference of fundamental terms in software design. This should give a high-level grasp of OOD conceptual space and guide to deeper dive into single topics.

- **[Tutorial](/tutorial)** &mdash; definitive complement to glossary + additional articles on motivation, subject, and method of OOD. This will help to understand *what* and - what is more important - *why*. Understanding *why* will help to deal with many practical issues easily and set a solid basement for building next levels of your expertise.

- **[Blog](/blog)** &mdash; 1) anything not suitable for glossary or tutorial yet potentially valuable for advanced study; 2) opinion on single design issues or most popular controversies; 3) anything beyond the OOD scope yet influential or otherwise related e.g. architecture, (cloud) technology, Agile etc.

### What it is *not*

1. **Re-telling** of what has been said by others. This website is in no way substitute for books and articles originally describing concepts we will talk about. We always try to refer to original authors and provide only interpretation of their words in a form specifically suitable for our goal (= make it attractive to novices). With that said, we do not mean original writings are bad or wrong! Based on our experience dealing with beginners (students first of all), we strive to provide information in a shape that will minimize the chances of skipping the subject as a whole.

2. **Triviality.** We try to make it simple, but not oversimplify to make it banal. We want to deliver same domain knowledge available elsewhere in writing or practice, but do it with less words. 

3. **Universality.** This website will not and should not cover everything. We purposefully omit certain topics — sometimes quite common and even very popular — that we think are not fundamental enough and can only distract and add needless complexity without bringing comparable value.

4. **Non-professionals-friendly.** This is not a general introduction to the field. Absolute newcomers to IT/CS/Soft.Eng. will probably find this website boring and/or too sophisticated.
